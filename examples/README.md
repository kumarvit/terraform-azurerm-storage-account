# Azure Storage Account creation with additional Resources

Configuration in this directory creates a set of Azure storage resources. Few of these resources added/excluded as per your requirement.

## Configure the Azure Provider

Add AzureRM provider to start with the module configuration. Whilst the `version` attribute is optional, we recommend, not to pinning to a given version of the Provider.

## Create resource group

By default, this module will not create a resource group and the name of an existing resource group to be given in an argument `resource_group_name`. If you want to create a new resource group, set the argument `resource_group_name = true`.

*If you are using an existing resource group, then this module uses the same resource group location to create all resources in this module.*

## Adding TAG's to your Azure resources

Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy. You apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production. This is expected and must provide the following details as per your environment. There are no default values available for these arguments.

Here I have added the values directly. However, you can manage these as variables under `variables.tf` as well.  

```
  application_name      = "TestApp1"
  owner_email           = "user@example.com"
  business_unit         = "publiccloud"
  costcenter_id         = "5847596"
  environment           = "development"
```

## Module Usage

## Storage account with Containers

Following example to create a storage account with a few containers.

```
module "storageacc" {
  source                  = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-storage?ref=v1.0.0"
  create_resource_group   = true
  resource_group_name     = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location                = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name    = "storageaccwesteupore01"

# Container lists wiht access_type to create
  containers_list = [
    { name        = "mystore250"
      access_type = "private"},
    { name        = "blobstore251"
      access_type = "blob"},
    { name      = "containter252"
      access_type = "container"}
  ]

  tags = {
    application_name      = "demoapp01"
    owner_email           = "user@example.com"
    business_unit         = "publiccloud"
    costcenter_id         = "5847596"
    environment           = "development"
  }
}
```

## SMB File Shares

Following example to create a storage account with few SMB files shares.

```
module "storageacc" {
  source                  = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-storage?ref=v1.0.0"
  create_resource_group   = true
  resource_group_name     = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location                = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name    = "storageaccwesteupore01"

# SMB file share with quota (GB) to create
  file_shares = [
    { name  = "smbfileshare1"
      quota = 50 },
    { name = "smbfileshare2"
      quota = 50 }
  ]

  tags = {
    application_name      = "demoapp01"
    owner_email           = "user@example.com"
    business_unit         = "publiccloud"
    costcenter_id         = "5847596"
    environment           = "development"
  }
}
```

## Storage Account with all additional features

Following example to create a storage account with containers and and SMB file shares resources.

```
module "storageacc" {
  source                  = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-storage?ref=v1.0.0"
  create_resource_group   = true
  resource_group_name     = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location                = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name    = "storageaccwesteupore01"

# Container lists wiht access_type to create
  containers_list = [
    { name        = "mystore250"
      access_type = "private"},
    { name        = "blobstore251"
      access_type = "blob"},
    { name      = "containter252"
      access_type = "container"}
  ]

# SMB file share with quota (GB) to create
  file_shares = [
    { name  = "smbfileshare1"
      quota = 50 },
    { name = "smbfileshare2"
      quota = 50 }
  ]

  tags = {
    application_name      = "demoapp01"
    owner_email           = "user@example.com"
    business_unit         = "publiccloud"
    costcenter_id         = "5847596"
    environment           = "development"
  }
}
```

## Terraform Usage

To run this example you need to execute following Terraform commands

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
