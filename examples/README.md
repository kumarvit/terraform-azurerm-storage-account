# Azure Storage Account creation with additional Resources

Configuration in this directory creates a set of Azure storage resources. Few of these resources added/excluded as per your requirement.

## Configure the Azure Provider

Add AzureRM provider to start with the module configuration. Whilst the `version` attribute is optional, we recommend, not to pinning to a given version of the Provider.

## Create resource group

By default, this module will not create a resource group and the name of an existing resource group to be given in an argument `resource_group_name`. If you want to create a new resource group, set the argument `create_resource_group = true`.

*If you are using an existing resource group, then this module uses the same resource group location to create all resources in this module.*

## Tagging

Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy. You can apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production. You can manage these values variables directly or mapping as a variable using `variables.tf`.

All Azure resources which support tagging can be tagged by specifying key-values in argument `tags`. Tag Name is added automatically on all resources. For example, you can specify `tags` like this:

```
module "storage" {
  source                = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-storage?ref=v1.0.0"
  create_resource_group = false

  # ... omitted

  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## Module Usage

## Storage account with Containers

Following example to create a storage account with a few containers.

```
module "storage" {
  source                = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-storage?ref=v1.0.0"
  
  #Resource Group
  create_resource_group = false
  resource_group_name   = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location              = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name  = "storageaccwesteupore01"

  # Container lists wiht access_type to create
  containers_list = [
    { name        = "mystore250"
      access_type = "private"},
    { name        = "blobstore251"
      access_type = "blob"},
    { name        = "containter252"
      access_type = "container"}
  ]

  # Tags for Azure resources
  tags = {
    Terraform     = "true"
    Environment   = "dev"
    Owner         = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## SMB File Shares

Following example to create a storage account with few SMB files shares.

```
module "storage" {
  source                = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-storage?ref=v1.0.0"
  
  #Resource Group
  create_resource_group = false
  resource_group_name   = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location              = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name  = "storageaccwesteupore01"

# SMB file share with quota (GB) to create
  file_shares   = [
      { name    = "smbfileshare1"
        quota   = 50 },
      { name    = "smbfileshare2"
        quota   = 50 }
  ]

  # Tags for Azure resources
  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## Storage Account with all additional features

Following example to create a storage account with containers and and SMB file shares resources.

```
module "storage" {
  source                = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-storage?ref=v1.0.0"
  
  #Resource Group
  create_resource_group = false
  resource_group_name   = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location              = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name  = "storageaccwesteupore01"

# Container lists wiht access_type to create
  containers_list = [
    { name        = "mystore250"
      access_type = "private"},
    { name        = "blobstore251"
      access_type = "blob"},
    { name      = "containter252"
      access_type = "container"}
  ]

# SMB file share with quota (GB) to create
  file_shares     = [
      { name      = "smbfileshare1"
        quota     = 50 },
      { name      = "smbfileshare2"
        quota     = 50 }
  ]

  # Tags for Azure resources
  tags = {
    Terraform     = "true"
    Environment   = "dev"
    Owner         = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## Terraform Usage

To run this example you need to execute following Terraform commands

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
